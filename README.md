# Agentic GenAI Frontend – Part 1

This repository contains the frontend exploration and UI/UX design work
for an agentic Generative AI application.

## Scope of Work (Part 1)
- Interactive frontend prototyping using Streamlit
- UI/UX research for agentic and GenAI applications
- Visual UI design using Figma
- Accelerated frontend exploration using Builder.io

## Folder Overview
### - streamlit-prototype/: 
Contains an interactive frontend prototype built using Streamlit.
This prototype was used to validate chat-first interaction patterns, agent lifecycle indicators (thinking, acting, done), session state management, and expandable reasoning logs before finalizing the UI design.
### - ui-ux-research/:
Includes notes and reference material from UI/UX research on agentic and Generative AI applications.
This folder documents observed design patterns such as chat-based interfaces, side-panel controls, agent status visibility, and progressive disclosure of logs and context.

### - figma-design/: 
Holds visual UI design artifacts created in Figma.
These designs define the layout, component hierarchy, and visual structure of the agentic frontend, including the sidebar, main chat area, message bubbles, and input bar.

### - builder-io/: 
Contains artifacts related to the exploration of Builder.io for accelerated frontend development.
This includes a reference to the live Builder.io page and screenshots demonstrating how the Figma-based design was translated into an interactive, component-based web UI.

Note: No LLM or backend integration is included at this stage.
